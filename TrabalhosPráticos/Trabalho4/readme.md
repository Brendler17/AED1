You have <b>n</b> jobs and <b>m</b> workers. You are given three arrays: <u><b>difficulty</b></u>, <u><b>profit</b></u>, and <u><b>worker</b></u> where:
<br>
- difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
<br>
- worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).
<br>
Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.
<br>
- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
<br>
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
